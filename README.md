ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

This project implements and compares two fundamental Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms â€” Primâ€™s and Kruskalâ€™s â€” using a custom Java graph structure.
The main goal is to evaluate both algorithms in terms of correctness, execution time, and operation count across multiple datasets of increasing graph size and density.

ðŸ§© Algorithms Implemented
	â€¢	Primâ€™s Algorithm: Builds MST by selecting minimum-weight edges that expand a connected set of vertices.
	â€¢	Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm: Sorts edges by weight and repeatedly joins the smallest edges without forming cycles, using a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) structure.

âœ” Both algorithms yield identical MST costs.
âš¡ Kruskalâ€™s algorithm consistently demonstrates superior performance for medium to large graphs.

ðŸ§  Conclusion

The results confirm theoretical predictions:
	â€¢	Primâ€™s performs better for small or dense graphs.
	â€¢	Kruskalâ€™s excels with large or sparse graphs due to its efficient sorting and Union-Find operations.
	â€¢	Both are correct and produce the same MST cost, but Kruskalâ€™s is more scalable in practice.
